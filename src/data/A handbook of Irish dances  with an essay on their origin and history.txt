THE    ORIGIN    AND    HISTORY 
OF    IRISH    DANCES. 

IT  is  with  a  feeling  of  anything 
but  satisfaction  that  one  arises 
from  a  perusal  of  extant  accessible 
Gaelic  literature  for  any  assistance 
in  tracing  tjhe  origin  of  Irish  dances. 
It  may  be  candidly  said  that  there 
are  no  allusions  whatever  to  danc- 
ing either  in  old  or  mediaeval  Irish 
literature.  The  one  text  to  which 
an  enquirer  would  naturally  first 
turn,  with  some  degree  of  confi- 
dence, for  information  on  the  sub- 
ject is  that  entitled  the  Fair  of  Loc 
Carman,  which  deals  with  an  an- 
cient festival  held  at  Loc  Carman, 
the  Wexford  of  to-day.  In  this 
very  old  and  interesting  text  there 
are  to  be  found  some  vivid  descrip- 
tions of  a  number  of  entertainers, 
and  of  musicians  in  particular,  who 
frequented  the  Fair,  but  there  is  no 
mention  made  of  the  man  of  dance. 

IT  is  true  that  the  name  Fer  Cen- 
gal,  occurring  in  that  text,  has  been 
interpreted  by  some  as  a  dancer, 
and  his  dance  has  even  been  com- 
pared to  the  German  Springen- 
dantz,  which  was  a  song  and  dance 
combined.  The  name,  however, 
suggests  an  acrobat  rather  than  a 
dancer,  but  as  it  does  not  appear 
elsewhere  in  Irish  literature  it 


Early 
Irish 
Litera- 
ture. 


Fer 

Cengal- 


would  be  unwise  to  build  any 
theories  on  it. 

IT  has  been  suggested  that  the  word 
Cronan,  which  is  mentioned  in  the 
sixth  century  by  St.  Cohnan  of 
Cloyne,  originally  meant  a  kind  of 
singing  accompaniment  for  dancing. 
There  is  no  evidence,  however,  in 
support  of  this  suggestion.  It  is 
now  generally  accepted  that  the 
word  originally  meant  a  musical 
bass,  and,  later,  a  curious  kind  of 
nasal  singing  accomplished  with  the 
mouth  shut.  To  the  latter  may 
possibly  be  ascribed  the  origin  of 
what  is  known  as  the  traditional 
style  of  Irish  singing. 

IT  has  been  inferred  from  the  ab- 
sence of  allusions  to  dancing  in 
early  Irish  literature  that  the  an- 
cient Irish  never  danced.  This 
theory,  besides  being  at  variance 
with  the  history  of  most  peoples  in 
their  primitive  state,  would  be  es- 
pecially strange  applied  to  a  race 
so  renowned  for  music  as  the  ancient 
Irish ;  for  it  is  scarcely  any  more 
possible  to  dissociate  Irish  dance 
from  Irish  music  in  early  times  than 
it  is  to-day.  O'Curry,  in  his  "  Man- 
ners and  Customs,"  describes  some 
fourteen  musical  instruments,  and 
as  many  musicians,  mentioned  in 
early  Irish  manuscripts ;  and  the 
native  historian  of  Wales,  Caradoc 


of  Llanarvan,  who  died  about  the 
year  1136,  writes  as  follows  about 
Irish  musicians  : — 

Another  class  of  minstrels  were  such  as 
played  upon  musical  instruments,  chiefly 
the  harp  and  crowd  (emit),  which 
Griffyth  ap  Conan  first  brought  over  into 
Wales,  who.  having  been  born  in  Ireland 
and  descended  on  his  mother's  side  of 
Irish  parents,  brought  with  him  from 
thence  several  skilful  musicians  who  in- 
vented all  the  instruments  as  were  played 
in  Wales. 

John  of  Salisbury,  writing  in  the 
twelfth  century,  says  : — 

The  attention  of  this  people  to  musical 
instruments  I  find  worthy  of  commenda- 
tion, in  which  their  skill  is  beyond 
comparison  superior  to  that  of  any  nation 


Galileo,  in  his  dialogue  on  ancient 
and  modern  music  (1582),  writes  of 
the  harp  : — 

This  very  ancient  instrument  was  brought 
to  us  from  Ireland  (as  Dante  has  re- 
corded) where  they  are  excellently  made 
and  in  great  number,  and  the  inhabit- 
ants of  which  island  have  practised  on 
it  for  centuries. 

Many  other  writers,  from  Giraldus 
Cambrensis  in  the  twelfth  century 
to  Stanihurst  in  the  sixteenth  cen- 
tury, speak  with  equal  warmth  of 
the  fame  of  Irish  music  and  music- 
ians. In  face  of  testimony  of  this 
kind  to  the  renown  of  early  Irish 
music  it  is  difficult  to  believe  that 
the  ancient  Irish  never  practised 
the  kindred  art  of  dance. 


Early

Music. 


THE  names  which  have  come  to  sig- 
nify the  titles  of  our  dances  do  not 
help  materially  in  tracing  the 
origin  of  the  dances  themselves. 
The  word  jig  has  been  derived  from 
the  Italian  Giga,  a  musical  measure 
which  was  very  popular  in  Ireland 
in  the  eighteenth  century.  It  is 
also  found  applied  to  a  light  metrical 
composition ;  thus  in  the  "  Passion- 
ate Pilgrim  "  we  read  : — 

All  my  merry  jigs  are  quite  forgot. 
And  in  a  tragedy  by  Chapman  the 
word   occurs   with   the  same  mean- 
ing : — 

'Tis   one  of   the   best  jigs  that  ever 
was  acted. 

The  derivation  of  the  word  reel  has 
been  the  subject  of  some  conjecture, 
but  in  no  instance  has  it  been  traced 
to  an  Irish  origin.  In  a  book,  en- 
titled "  News  from  Scotland  "  (1598) 
it  is  found  mentioned  as  a  dance :  — 

Silas  Duncan  did  go  before  them  playing 
this  reill  or  dance  upon  a  small  trump. 
THE  Irish  words  for  jig  and  reel, 
namely  Port  and  Cor  respectively, 
signified  the  tunes  merely,  and  do 
not  appear  to  have  been  applied  to 
the  dances  until  comparatively  re- 
cent times.  O'Curry  quotes  the 
phrase  : — 

"  T»o  funneA-o  puipc  •]  coifi  -0616," 
that  is,  ports  and  cors  were  played  for 
them.     The  word  port  is  also  found 


in  the  names  of  many  airs,  gener- 
ally assigned  to  Scotland,  such  as 
Port  Gordon,  Port  Lennox.  These 
were,  however,  composed  by  the 
Irish  harpers,  O'Cahan  and  the  two 
O'Connellans,  during  their  wander- 
ings in  Scotland  in  the  seventeenth 
century.  But  whatever  may  have 
been  the  signification  of  these  words 
in  the  past,  they  have  come  to-day 
to  mean  the  dances  as  well  as  the 
tunes ;  and  whatever  may  have 
been  the  origin  of  the  jig  and  reel 
dances,  we  have  made  them  our  own 
by  love,  and  we  have  given  to  them 
a  character  and  a  colour  which  are 
wholly  our  own.  There  is  certainly 
no  evidence  to  show  that  the  jig,  as 
it  has  been  danced  in  Ireland  for  the 
past  century,  is  of  great  antiquity ; 
on  the  contrary,  all  evidence  points 
rather  to  the  fact  that  it  is  com- 
paratively modern,  and  that  in  its 
earliest  form  it  was  a  Round,  or 
Long  dance,  a  Hey  de  Gigue  in  fact, 
as  it  is  termed  in  literature. 

THE  question  may  well  be  asked  : 
if  our  jig  step  dance  in  its  present 
form  is  modern,  are  our  jig  tunes 
of  modern  growth  also  ?  This  ques- 
tion has  been  answered  in  Grove's 
Dictionary  of  Music  in  an  article  on 
Irish  Music.  We  are  there  in- 
formed with  the  air  of  authority 
that  "  the  jig  was,  as  its  name  im- 
plies, an  imitation  of  the  Giga  of 


Corelli  and  Geminiani,  both  very 
popular  in  Ireland  in  the  eighteenth 
century  "  ;  in  other  words,  that  the 
immense  body  of  jig  measures  exist- 
ing to-day  in  Ireland,  both  published 
and  unpublished,  owe  their  origin 
to  the  Italian  Giga.  In  the  same 
article  a  list  of  important  collec- 
tions of  Irish  music  is  given,  the 
earliest  of  which — Burke  Thumoth's 
collection — is  assigned  by  the  writer 
of  the  article  to  the  year  1720,  that 
is  before  the  influence  of  the  modes 
of  Corelli  and  Geminiani.  In  this 
collection  of  twenty-four  Irish  tunes 
there  are  some  jig  tunes,  and  there 
are  many  more  in  the  editions  of 
Playford's  "  Dancing  Master  "  which 
appeared  between  the  years  1650 
and  1700.  But  apart  from  the 
mass  of  evidence  which  can  be  ad- 
duced to  prove  that  the  jig  existed 
in  Ireland  long  before  the  eighteenth 
century,  the  distinctive  character  of 
our  jig  tunes  is  the  strongest  refu- 
tation of  the  theory  that  they  are 
of  Italian  origin.  For  it  may  be 
truly  said  that  there  is  not  in  one 
of  them  an  echo  of  the  school  of 
Corelli  and  Geminiani. 

THERE  is  no  suggestion  that  Irish 
reel  tunes,  though  almost  as  numer- 
ous as  Irish  jig  tunes,  owe  their 
origin  to  the  Italian  or,  indeed,  to 
any  other  school  of  music.  Never- 
theless it  would  bo  as  reasonable  to 


assign  to  them  an  Italian  origin  as 
it  is  to  assign  to  the  Irish  jig  an 
Italian  origin.  Students  of  Irish 
traditional  music  will  rather  incline 
to  the  view  of  Dr.  Petrie,  that  our 
jig  tunes — and  he  might  have  added 
our  reel  tunes — were  originally 
clan  marches. 

IT  is  when  we  come  to  Anglo-Irish 
and  to  English  literature  that  we 
come  into  the  region  of  fact,  from 
which  certain  deductions  may  be 
drawn  regarding  our  early  dances. 
There  are  three  Irish  dances  fre- 
quently mentioned  in  sixteenth  cen- 
tury writings ;  the  Irish  Hey,  the 
Trenchmore,  and  the  Rinnce  Fada. 
Nash,  in  his  "Shepherd's  Holi- 
day," published  in  1598,  speaks  of 

Roundelayg  and  Irish  Hays ; 
and  in  Martin's  Month's  Mind  (1589) 
we  read  of 

Hay?,  jiggs,  and  roundelays. 
Spencer  speaks  of  the  Hey  de  Gie, 
and  in  "  A  West  Country  Jig,"  pub- 
lished in  the  Roxburghe  collection, 
we  read  : — 

The  piper  he  struck  up 
And  merrily   be  did  play 
The  shaking  of  the  sheets 
And  eke  the  Irish  Hey. 
Allusions  to  Irish  Heys  are  frequent 
in  many  of  the  well-known  plays  of 
the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth   cen- 
turies, plays  by  Middleton,  Marston, 


Massinger,  Heywood,  Dekker,  and 
Shirley. 

In  Sir  John  Davies'  "  Orchestra  " 
we  read,  "  He  taught  them  rounds 
and  winding  heys  to  tread  " — in  the 
margin  he  explains  these  measures 
as  country  dances. 

What  was  this  Hey  so  frequently 
referred  to  ?  In  a  book,  entitled  the 
"  Complainte  of  Scotland  "  (1549)  we 
are  told  that  a  certain  dance  was  led 
off  in  a  Hey  or  circle,  and  of  another 
dance  it  is  stated  that  "the  men 
stand  still,  the  women  going  the 
Hey  between  them  "  ;  that  is,  wind- 
ing in  and  out.  At  least  that  is  the 
way  in  which  the  Hey  is  described 
in  an  old  French  work  on  dancing, 
entitled,  "  Orchesographie,"  written 
by  one  Thoinot  Arbeay,  and  pub- 
lished at  Langres  in  1588. 

These  references  point  to  the  exist- 
ence in  Ireland  at  a  very  early  date, 
as  early,  at  any  rate,  as  the  year 
1550,  of  a  round  dance  in  which  a 
number  of  men  and  women  took  part. 
Taking  this  evidence  side  by  side 
with  the  fact  that  in  some  of  our 
present  Round  dances  we  find  the 
word  Hey  applied  to  a  certain  sec- 
tion of  the  dance,  it  may  reasonably 
be  inferred  that  the  old  Irish  Hey 
was  the  earliest  and  simplest  form  of 
our  modern  Round  dances,  such  as 
those  described  in  Part  IV,  of  this 
work. 


ALLUSIONS  to  the  dance  called 
Trenchmore  are  quite  as  numerous 
as  they  are  to  the  Hey  in  sixteenth 
century  literature.  In  a  morality 
by  William  Bulleyn  we  read  of  per- 
sons dancing  Trenchmore  and  Hey 
de  Gie.  Burton,  in  his  Anatomy  of 
Melancholy,  says  :  "  We  must  dance 
Trenchmore  over  tables,  chairs,  and 
stools,"  from  which  it  may  be  in- 
ferred that  it  was  a  somewhat  lively 
measure.  Sometimes  it  is  referred 
to  as  a  tune.  In  one  play  the  earth, 
sun,  and  moon  are  made  to  dance 
the  Hey  to  the  tune  of  Trenchmore. 
Having  regard  to  the  fact  that  we 
find  the  word  Rinnce  in  such  forms 
as  Ring,  Trink,  Trenk,  etc.,  it  is  not 
unreasonable  to  assume  that  the 
word  Trenchmore  is  simply  Rinnce 
Mor,  a  term  which,  even  to  the  pre- 
sent time,  is  applied  to  certain  Irish 
country  dances. 

OP  the  antiquity  of  the  celebrated 
Rinnce  Fada  there  is  no  longer  any 
doubt.  One  of  the  earliest — if  not, 
indeed,  the  very  earliest — references 
bearing  on  it,  dates  back  to  the  year 
1549.  It  is  found  in  a  work,  to 
which  allusion  has  been  already  made 
in  connection  with  the  Hey,  entitled 
the  "  Complainte  of  Scotland." 

The  Ring  danoe,  it  is  there  stated,  was 
formerly  a  favourite  in  the  South  of 
Scotland,  though  now  fallen  into  desue- 
tude. It  was  the  common  dance  at 
the  Kirn,  a  feast  of  cutting  down  the.

grain,  and  was  always  danced  with  pe- 
culiar glee  by  the  reapers  of  that  farm 
where  the  harvest  was  first  finished  in 
any  district.  On  such  occasions  they 
danced  on  an  eminence  in  view  of  the 
reapers  in  their  vicinity  to  the  music 
of  the  Lowland  pipe,  commencing  the 
dance  with  three  loud  shouts  of  triumph, 
and  thrice  tossing  up  their  hooks  in  the 
air.  The  intervals  of  labour  during 
harvest  were  often  occupied  by  dancing 
the  Ring  to  the  music  of  the  piper  who 
attended  the  reapers.  This  dance  is 
still  retained  among  the  Highlanders 
who  frequently  dance  the  Ring  in  the 
open  fields  when  they  visit  the  South 
of  Scotland,  as  reapers,  during  the 
autumnal  months.  Similar  seems  to  be 
the  Rinnce  Fada,  Rinky,  or  Field  dance 
of  the  Irish. 

Here  we  have  positive  evidence  of 
the  existence  in  Ireland  of  the 
Rinnce  Fada  as  far  back  as  1549, 
and  that  its  name  and  its  repute  had 
spread  to  Scotland  at  that  date.  It 
will  be  seen  that  the  writer  surmises 
that  the  Irish  and  Scottish  dances 
were  similar.  What  is  more  likely 
than  that  the  Irish  dance  was  taken 
to  Scotland  in  the  early  migrations 
of  the  Gael  ^from  the  North  of 
Ireland  to  Scotland? 

In  a  work,  entitled,  "  A  Voyage 
through  the  Kingdom  of  Ireland," 
written  in  the  year  1681  by  a  tra- 
veller named  Dineley,  there  is  the 
following  reference  to  the  Rinnco 
Fada  : — 

They  (the  Irish)  are  much  addicted,  on 
holidays,  with  the  bagpipe,  Irish  harps, 


xin 

and  Jews  harps,  to  dance  after  their 
country  fashion,  that  is  the  long  dance, 
one  after  another,  of  all  conditions, 
masters,  mistresses,  and  servants. 

The  Kinnce  Facia,  like  the  Hey, 
panetrated  to  England.  We  find  it 
referred  to  by  Beaumont  and 
Fletcher  : 

Fading  is   a  fine    jig    I   assure  you 
gentlemen. 

Allusion  is  also  made  to  it  in  Shir- 
ley's play,  a  "Bird  in  the  Cage," 
and  Shakespeare  in  the  "  Winter's 
Tale"  has 

Their  dildos  and  fadings. 
Irish  literature  of  the  seventeenth 
and  eighteenth  centuries  abounds 
with  references  to  the  Rinnce  Fada, 
and  Lady  Morgan,  writing  in  the 
beginning  of  the  nineteenth  century, 
says  that  it  was  danced  everywhere 
through  the  County  Limerick,  and  in 
other  parts  of  Ireland,  on  the  eve  of 
May,  that  is,  the  feast  of  Bealtaine. 
In  her  book,  "  The  Wild  Irish  Girl," 
she  writes  as  follows  of  this  dance  :— 

Besides  the  Irish  jig,  tradition  has 
rescued  from  that  oblivion  which  time 
has  hung  over  Irish  dance,  the  Rinnce 
Fada,  which  answers  to  the  festal  dance 
of  the  Greeks;  and  the  Rkmceadn  or 
war  dance  which  seems,  says  Walker, 
to  have  been  of  the  nature  of  the  armed 
dance  which  is  so  ancient,  and  with 
which  the  Grecian  youth  amused  them- 
selves during  the  siege  of  Troy. 

In  this  dance,  as  performed  to-day, 
and  for  the  past  century,  the  men 


Rinnce  :  all  stand  in  a  row,  their  partners 
Fad  a.  i'acing  them,  forming  another  row. 
The  dancing  begins  at  one  end,  and 
gradually  works  along  through  the 
whole  line  until  all  are  stepping.  In 
its  earliest  form,  however,  it  was 
somewhat  different,  as  will  appear 
from  the  following  very  early  descrip- 
tion of  it : — 

Th-ree  persons  abreast  holding  the  ends 
of  white  handkerchiefs,  moved  forward 
a  few  paces  to  the  sound  of  slow  music, 
the  rest  of  the  dancers  following  in 
couples,  also  holding  white  handker- 
chiefs between  them.  The  music  then 
changed  to  a  quicker  time  and  the  dance 
proper  began,  the  performers  passing  suc- 
cessively under  the  handkerchiefs  of  the 
three  in  front,  then  wheeling  round  in 
semi-circles,  they  formed  a  variety  of 
figures  interspersed  with  various  entre- 
chats, finally  uniting  and  resuming  their 
original  places.  This  dance  was  accom- 
panied by  the  Cuisle-ciuil. 


On  the  arrival  of  James  II.  at 
Kinsale  his  adherents  received  the 
unfortunate  prince  on  the  shore  with 
this  dance,  which  is  said  to  have 
given  him  infinite  delight.  There  is 
abundant  testimony,  too,  to  show 
that  up  to  the  beginning  of  the  nine- 
teenth century  both  private  and 
public  balls  always  concluded  with 
the  Rinnce  Fada ;  and  John 
O'Keeffe,  the  dramatist,  in  his 
"  Recollections  "  dating  back  to  the 
year  1750,  says  that  in  his  time 
every  comedy  and  comic  opera  per- 


XV 

formed  in  Ireland  ended  with  a 
country  dance  by  the  characters 
which  had,  he  observes,  "  a  most  ex- 
hilarating effect  on  both  the  per- 
formers and  onlookers." 

Patrick  Kennedy,  in  his  book, 
"  The  Banks  of  the  Boro,"  speaks  of 
the  Rinnce  Fada  as  he  saw  it  danced 
in  the  year  1812,  and  though  he  does 
not  describe  the  dance  itself,  he 
gives  an  account  of  the  dress  worn 
by  the  men  and  women  who  took 
part  in  it. 

They  were  in  their  shirt  sleeves,  waist- 
coats, knee  breeches,  white  Btock'iigs  and 
turn  pumps,  all  bright  colours  around 
their  waists  and  ribbons  of  bright  hue 
encircling  heads,  shirt  sleeves,  knees,  and 
boota,  the  shoulders  getting  more  than 
was  their  due.  The  girls  had  their 
hair  decked  with  ribbons  and  were  in 
their  Sunday  garb. 

It  is  difficult  to-day  to  realise  the 
extent  to  which  Irish  dance  and 
Irish  music  permeated  English  life 
in  the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth  cen- 
turies. In  a  book,  well-known  anc 
very  valuable  to  students  of  ancient 
Irish  music,  Playford's  "  Dancing 
Master,"  successive  editions  of  which 
appeared  between  the  years  1650  anc 
1725,  there  is  a  considerable  number 
of  Irish  danoe  tunes  given  with 
key — now  scarcely  intelligible — t 
the  dance  which  was  performed  to 
each  tune.  The  following  are  some 


Rinnce 
ada. 


of  the  Irish  tunes  which  appear  in 
the  early  editions  : — 

Ballinamore. 

Kerry  Reel. 

Moll  in  the  Wad. 

Bantry  Bay. 

Humours  of  Cork. 

Nora  Crionna. 

Th«  Irishman  in  Spain.

The  Lakes    of  Wicklow. 

The  Irish   Trot 

Lillibulero. 

The  Irish  Boree. 

The  Irish   Ground. 

The  Rinnce  Fada  extended  even  to 
Cornwall,  where  it  became  a  great 
festal  dance,  which  is  still  performed 
every  year  in  the  village  of  HeLston. 
It  is  there  known  as  the  Fade,  and 
sometimes  as  the  Furry  dance. 
From  the  numerous  descriptions 
given  of  it,  however,  there  is  little 
doubt  that  it  is  the  Irish  Rinnce 
Fada. 

WITH  the  single  exception  of  the 
hornpipe,  about  the  origin  of  which 
there  is  considerable  doubt,  all  the 
evidence  that  can  be  adduced  on  tbe 
subject  goes  to  show  that  the  Round 
and  Long  dances  are  older  than  the 
step  or  single  dances.  It  has  been 
already  suggested  that  the  old  Irish 
Hey  is  the  earliest  and  simplest  form 
of  our  present  round  dances.  This 
theory  is  supported  by  historical  and 
traditional  evidence.  Vallancey,  in 


his  "  Collectanea,"  dating  back  to 
the  year  1680,  mentions  the  Rinnce 
Timcioll,  or  Round  Dance,  being 
danced  in  a  circle  by  the  "  vulgar 
Irish,"  and  Arthur  Young,  whose 
work  on  Ireland  covers  the  years 
1776  to  1779,  mentions  country 
dances  being  danced  everywhere  in 
addition  to  jigs  and  reels.  More- 
over, many  of  the  Round  dances  des- 
cribed in  detail  in  Part  IV.  of  this 
book  were  seen  sixty  years  ago  being 
taught  by  dancing-masters  who  were 
then  sixty  or  seventy  years  of  age, 
and  generally  in  places  the  most  re- 
mote from  outside  influence,  cer- 
tainly from  the  influence  of  the 
dancing-master  of  the  old  French 
court,  whose  modes  spread  to  Eng- 
land. Notwithstanding  evidence  of 
this  character  it  has  been  advanced 
from  time  to  time  that  these  Round 
dances  are  not  Irish  dances  at  all, 
but  English  or  French  dances,  some- 
what altered  in  the  process  of  years. 
Even  if  this  were  the  case,  no  reason- 
able person  would  advance  it  as  the 
sole  cause  for  rejecting  them  any 
more  than  he  would  reject  from  the 
Irish  language  the  many  Latin 
words  which  have  crept  into  it  since 
the  days  of  St.  Patrick.  Apart  from 
any  question  of  their  origin,  they 
differ  to-day  in  so  many  essentials 
from  any  other  dances,  and  they 
have  been  so  long  a  portion  of  us 
that  they  have  surely  a  claim  to  be 


called  Irish.  But  what  are  the 
grounds  on  which  they  are  assumed 
o  be  of  foreign  origin?  It  is  diffi- 
jult  to  say,  unless  it  is  because  some 
of  them  are  danced  by  four  couples 
standing  in  a  circle  just  as  in  a  set 
of  quadrilles,  or  because  there  are 
one  or  two  movements,  of  a  very  sub- 
sidiary kind,  which  bear  a  resem- 
3lance  to  movements  in  the  quad- 
rilles. Many  of  the  Irish  round 
dances  are  certainly  danced  by  four 
couples  standing  in  a  circle,  but  what 
of  the  other  Irish  round  dances,  in 
hich  only  two  couple.?  dance  ?  And 
what  of  the  six,  twelve,  and  sixteen 
hand  reels  P  To  what  English  or 
French  dances  are  we  to  look  for 
their  origin?  Again,  in  quadrilles 
and  kindred  dances,  the  musical  time 
changes  for  each  section  of  the 
dance ;  not  so  in  the  Irish  dances ; 
they  are  danced  in  one  time  from  be- 
ginning to  end.  Moreover,  the  fun- 
damental movement  throughout  in 
the  Irish  round  "dances  is  the  side- 
step, which  is  not  found  in  any  dance 
outside  Ireland. 

The  theory  that  Irish  Round 
lances  are  derived  from,  or  even 
have  been  influenced  by  dances  such 
as  the  Quadrilles,  cannot  be  sus- 
tained. Their  origin  must  be  sought 
far  back  in  the  history  of  the  Irish 
race.  In  this  connection  it  may  be 
observed  that  no  enquiry  into  the 
origin  and  growth  of  Irish  dances 


can  be  regarded  as  complete  until  a 
number  of  questions  regarding  the 
origin  and  growth  of  Irish  music 
have  been  settled ;  for  it  is  almost 
beyond  doubt  that  each  re-acted  on 
the  other  to  a  very  considerable 
degree. 

But  when  all  is  said  for  and 
against  the  Irish  Round  dances, 
their  strongest  recommendation  to- 
day is  that  they  furnish  the  best  sub- 
stitute for  Quadrilles  and  kindred 
dances.  Jigs  and  reels  and  horn- 
pipes can,  we  know,  become  monoto- 
nous, by  much  repetition,  to  the  on- 
lookers, and  both  monotonous  and 
fatiguing  to  the  dancers ;  but  the 
Round  dances,  with  the  ever  changing 
positions  of  the  dancers,  and  the  oc- 
casional rests  afforded  by  the  figures, 
possess  all  the  variety  of  Quadrilles, 
and  far  more  sprightliness. 

IN  addition  to  the  Round  and  Long 
dances,  which  have  just  been  referred 
to,  and  to  which  this  book  is  chiefly 
devoted,  there  were  a  number  of 
peculiar  dances  existing  in  Ireland 
some  of  them  down  even  to  the 
middle  of  the  nineteenth  century. 
These  were  mostly  pantomimic 
dances ;  imitations,  as  it  were,  in 
measured  and  rhythmical  mov< 
ments  of  certain  occupations.  Some 
of  these  dances  are  described  in  Parl 
V.  of  this  work.  Most  of  them  bear 
the  stamp  of  considerable  antiquity ;

they  appear,  in  fact,  to  have  been, 
with  the  Hey  and  Rinnce  Fada,  the 
earliest  forms  of  Irish  dances.  It  is 
with  feelings  of  regret  that  one  has 
to  chronicle  their  disappearance  from 
Irish  life.  Apart  from  their  quaint- 
ness  and  the  colour  they  lent  to  rural 
life,  they  must,  in  their  very  nature, 
have  possessed  a  grace  and  dignity 
which,  in  most  of  our  modern  dances, 
are  conspicuous  by  their  absence,  at 
least  as  they  are  usually  danced  to- 
day. 

THE  four  principal  Irish  step-dances, 
that  is,  the  jig,  reel,  hornpipe,  and 
hop-jig,  are  so  familiar  a  feature  in 
modern  Irish  life  that  they  call  for 
little  comment  here.  No  attempt  is 
made  in  this  book  to  describe  the 
many  steps  of  these  dances,  but  in 
the  section  devoted  to  "  Other 
Dances  "  a  brief  account  is  given  of 
the  positions  to  be  occupied  by  the 
dancers,  and  the  "  figure "  move- 
ments which  are  usual  between  the 
dancing  of  the  actual  steps. 

One  of  the  most  extraordinary 
features  in  connection  with  these 
dances  is  the  number  of  steps  which 
pertain  to  them.  Numerous  as  are 
the  Irish  dance  tunes,  the  steps  are 
even  more  numerous.  And  just  as 
the  tunes  differ,  one  from  another 
(though  in  the  one  time  and  of  the 
one  character)  to  a  considerable  de- 
gree, so  do  the  steps  differ  one  from 


another  in  almost  every  feature  ex- 
cept character.  Another  remark-  | 
able  feature  in  connection  with  these 
dances  is  the  manner  in  which  the 
steps  have  been  diffused  throughout 
the  whole  country.  The  same  steps 
may  be  seen  danced  to-day  from 
Kerry  to  Donegal,  with  but  slender 
differences  here  and  there  ;  and  even 
the  order  in  which  they  are  danced 
is  often — as  it  should  be  always — the 
same.  In  the  jig,  for  example,  the 
traditional  dancer  invariably  begins 
with  the  "  rising-step,"  and  worka 
up  from  that  simple  form  through 
easy  gradations  to  the  most  intri- 
cate steps.  In  the  reel  the  beautiful 
"side-step"  should  be  the  initial 
movement. 

IT  is  of  some  interest  to  speculate  on 
the  age  of  these  steps.  All  the  evi- 
dence on  the  point  tends  to  show 
that  they  are  comparatively  modern, 
that  they  were,  in  fact,  the  creation 
of  the  dancing-masters  of  the  eight- 
eenth and  nineteenth  centuries.  In 
the  first  place,  almost  all  references 
to  Irish  dances  in  literature,  down 
to  the  beginning  of  the  eighteenth 
century,  deal  only  with  Round  and 
Long  dances,  and  in  the  next  place 
there  is  a  marked  absence  of  any 
indication  of  the  existence  of  the 
dancing-master  until  about  the  same 
time.  It  was,  evidently,  this  pro- 
fessor of  dancing  who  invented  the

many  intricate  "  steps,"  proceeding 
by  a  gradual  elaboration  of  the 
simple  forms  used  in  the  Round  and 
Long  dances.  The  dancing-master 
was  always  expected  to  invent  steps, 
and,  in  fact,  it  was  by  his  powers  of 
invention  as  much  as  by  his  skill  in 
dancing,  and  his  manner  of  impart- 
ing the  art  to  others  that  he 
achieved  renown.  Literature  and 
tradition  are  almost  silent  concern- 
ing the  dancing-master  down  to  the 
eighteenth  century;  but  there  is 
abundant  proof  of  his  existence,  one 
might  add  of  his  ubiquity,  in  the 
eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries. 

JUDGING  by  the  number  of  dancing- 
masters,  and  the  position  to  which 
"  step  ''-dancing  had  attained  at  the 
beginning  of  the  nineteenth  century, 
it  is  evident  that  the  art  was 
sedulously  cultivated  during  the 
whole  of  the  preceding  century. 
There  were  at  least  three  great 
schools  of  dancing  in  Ireland  about 
the  year  1800;  those  of  Kerry, 
Limerick,  and  Cork.  There  were, 
doubtless,  others,  but  they  do  not 
appear  to  have  attained  the  renown 
of  the  three  great  Munster  schools. 
The  fame  of  Munster  dancing  is  at- 
tested to  by  many  writers  of  the 
eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries. 
Carolan,  for  example,  speaks  of

In  Kerry  alone  there  were  pro- 
fessors of  Irish  dance  whose  fame 
was  as  wide,  at  least,  as  Ireland. 
The  great  O'Kearin,  who  flourished 
in  the  end  of  the  eighteenth  and  be- 
ginning of  the  nineteenth  century, 
was  a  man  who,  in  a  country  liki? 
France  of  the  seventeenth  century, 
would  have  found  his  way  into  the 
history  of  the  period  as  a  man  of 
genius.  To  O'Kearin  was  largely 
due  the  crystalization,  if  we  may  say 
so,  of  Irish  dances;  he  it  was  who 
helped  largely  to  reduce  them  to  the 
order  and  uniformity  they  have  at- 
tained, a  uniformity  which  was  very 
remarkable,  and  which  was  common 
to  the  four  principal  step  dances. 
The  Limerick  dancing-master,  in  the 
best  days  of  Irish  step-dancing,  was 
a  worthy  and  (in  the  person  of  a  man 
like  Tadhg  Ruadh  O'Scanlan)  a  veri- 
table rival  of  the  Kerry  man. 

TUB  "  Figure  "  (or  as  they  are  some- 
times called,  "set"  and  "long  set") 
dances  appear  also  to  have  been  the 
creation  of  the  dancing-masters  of 
the  past  century.  They  consist  of 
measures  fashioned  mostly  to  tunes 
like  "St.  Patrick's  Day,"  "The 
Blackbird,"  and  certain  of  Carolan's 
Planxtys,  which  do  not  conform  to 
the  usual  structure  of  "  regular " 
jigs  and  reels,  that  is,  which  do  not 
consist  of  two  parts  with  eight  bars 
in  each.  The  name  is  derived  from

the  figure  which  is  woven  into  each 
of  them ;  in  some  it  is  simple,  in 
others  it  is  extremely  complex,  but 
in  every  case  it  differs  from  the 
figure  movement  performed  between 
the  actual  steps  of  the  jig  and  reel. 
A  list  of  some  of  these  dances  is  given 
in  Part  V.,  together  with  a  brief 
description  of  the  manner  in  which 
they  are  danced. 

THERE  are  some  features  in  connec- 
tion with  Irish  dancing  as  it  is  seen 
to-day  in  Irish  town's  and  cities 
which  call  for  passing  comment.  The 
first  thing  that  strikes  any  observer 
is  that  ease  and  grace  and  beauty  of 
movement  are  almost  invariably 
sacrificed  to  complexity  of  steps. 
When  will  Irish  dancers  understand 
that  the  simplest  steps  beautifully 
danced  give  more  pleasure  than  the 
most  difficult  steps  danced  with  an 
awkward  carriage  of  the  body  and 
with  obvious  physical  distress  ?  It 
must  be  patent  to  anybody  who  has 
given  the  subject  a  moment's  con- 
sideration that  jigs,  reels,  and  horn- 
pipes, danced  without  grace  and 
ease,  become  athletic  exercises  pure 
and  simple,  and  very  often  ugly  ones 
at  that.  A  perfect  step-dancer  is 
not  always  beating  the  floor 
violently,  neither  is  he  flying  about 
from  one  end  of  a  platform  to 
another ;  his  movements  are  all  easy 
and  are  performed  with  a  certain 


stateliness,  and  the  time  is  clearly 
but  not  violently  marked.  Generally 
speaking,  the  step-dances  are  danced 
much  quicker  than  they  should  be. 
No  dance,  no  matter  how  accurately 
the  step  may  be  performed  or  the 
time  marked,  can  possibly  look  beau- 
tiful if  it  is  danced — as  frequently 
happens — twice  as  rapidly  as  it 
should  be. 

Another  feature  very  noticeable 
to-day  is  that  men  and  women  are 
frequently  seen  to  dance  precisely 
the  same  steps.  This  is  entirely  at 
variance  with  the  practice  of  the  old 
dancing-masters,  who  always  taught 
women  steps  of  a  lighter  and  simpler 
character  than  those  taught  to  men. 
This  was  in  harmony  with  the 
general  good  taste  of  the  old 
dancing-master,  a  man  usually  of 
courtly  ways  and  fine  manners,  ever 
jealous  for  the  dignity  of  his  profes- 
sion. To  such  a  man  it  would  have 
been  a  source  of  the  utmost  pain  to 
witness  a  girl  "  treble  "  or  "  batter  " 
or  perform  other  manly  steps;  he 
possessed  a  large  repertory  of  light, 
somewhat  dainty  steps  for  women, 
which  were  so  framed  as  to  make  up 
in  grace  what  they  lacked  in  com- 
plexity. In  this  connection  Dr.  P. 
W.  Joyce,  in  his  contribution  on 
Irish  dances  to  Dr.  Petrie's  Ancient 
Music  of  Ireland,  observes  that  the 
women  of  Cork  emulated  the  men  of 
that  county,  whereas  the  women  of 


Modern 

Irish 

Dancing. 


Limerick  were  far  more  staid  in 
their  dancing,  and  would  have 
thought  it  quite  unbecoming  to 
dance  men's  steps  as  the  Cork  women 
did. 

Much  has  been  said  from  time  to 
time  on  the  hostility  shown  by  many 
persons  in  Ireland  to  dancing. 
Efappily  that  hostility  is  rapidly 
waning,  and  it  is  not  too  much  to 
hope  that  it  will  wholly  disappear  in 
the  presence  of  Irish  dances. 

If  we  have  dwelt  at  length  on  the 
historical  aspect  of  Irish  dances,  it 
is  largely,  if  not  solely,  because  it  is 
our  belief  that  any  true  account  of 
them  should  be  an  important  in- 
fluence in  the  spread  and  develop- 
ment of  these  same  dances  in  the 
future.  No  country,  and  least  of 
all  Ireland,  can  afford  to  ignore  its 
pastimes.  Besides  it  would  be  im- 
possible to  detachthe  magnificent  body 
of  Irish  dance  music  from  the  dances 
themselves.  We  are  concerned  to- 
day, all  of  us,  with  the  study  of  old 
Irish  music  ;  it  would  be  incongruous 
if  we  were  not  concurrently  inter- 
ested in  the  dances  to  which  so  much 
of  that  music  pertains.  If  we  are  to 
have  a  revival  of  things  Irish  we  can- 
not in  reason  pass  by  the  dances. 
This,  however,  is  only  the  academic 
view  of  the  question.  The  study  of 
Irish  dances  can  well  afford  to  be  put 
on  a  higher  plane  of  consideration. 
No  one  who  has  given  any  thought 


to  our  town,  and  village,  and,  above 
all,  to  our  rural  life,  can  deny  that 
it  is  sadly  lacking  in  the  most  ele- 
mentary resources  of  pleasure.  This 
dulness,  this  death  in  life,  has  often 
been  advanced,  and  surely  with  jus- 
tice, as  one  of  the  many  reasons  for 
the  terrible  drain  of  emigration  from 
our  country.  Everywhere  people 
tell  you  that  beyond  the  daily  round 
of  labour  there  is  nothing  to  look 
forward  to  in  Irish  provincial  life. 
Can  it,  therefore,  be  a  matter  for 
surprise  that  the  noisy  streets  and 
music  halls  of  foreign  cities  allure 
our  people?  It  was  not  so  at  any 
time,  BO  far  as  we  are  aware, 
in  Irish  history  down  to  the 
end  of  the  eighteenth  century. 
Town  and  country  life  in  Ireland, 
for  many  centuries  within  the  ken  of 
observant  travellers,  appears  to  have 
resounded  with  the  music  of  the 
pipes  and  the  accompanying  move- 
ments of  the  dancers.  We  would 
desire  to  see  once  more  the  village 
cross-roads  peopled  with  merry  groups 
of  dancers,  to  hear  the  music  of  the 
pipes  borne  down  the  lanes  between 
the  whitethorn  trees,  in  the  interval 
between  the  long  day  of  labour  and 
the  night  of  rest.

INTRODUCTION. 

IN  the  description  of  various  round  and 
long  dances  given  in  this  book,  it  has 
been  generally  assumed  that  the  learner 
has  a  knowledge  of  the  elementary  steps 
required,  namely  the  side-step,  the  ris- 
ing-step, and  (for  ladies)  the  "  shuffle." 

It  is  quite  clear  that  no  satisfactory 
description  could  be  given  in  writing 
of  the  many  complex  steps  comprised 
in  Irish  dancing,  and  therefore  no  at- 
tempt of  the  sort,  beyond  a  brief  de- 
scription of  the  side-step,  has  been  made 
in  this  work — neither  has  an  attempt 
been  made  to  describe  any  danoe  which 
necessitates  a  knowledge  of  anything  be- 
yond these  elementary  steps,  with  the 
one  exception  of  the  Hop-time  country 
dance.  A  list  of  some  of  these  dances 
is,  however,  given,  and  the  reader  de- 
sirous of  becoming  acquainted  with  them 
should  learn  the  necessary  steps  and 
style  of  dancing  from  some  one  who 
possesses  a  perfect  knowledge  of  both. 

THERE  is  a  tendency  at  present  to  pay 
too  little  attention  to  the  elementary 
steps  necessary  for  the  proper  dancing 
of  round  and  long  dances.  As  these 
steps  are  most  characteristic,  it  is  in- 
dispensable that  a  knowledge  of  them 
should  be  fully  acquired  before  proceed- 
ing to  learn  any  round  or  long  dances. 

THE  side-step  forms  the  backbone  of  the 
majority  of  Irish  round  dances,  it  is 
therefore  considered  desirable  to  give  a 
brief  description  of  it. 


Steps 


Side-step 


Side-step 


If  dancing  in  the  direction  of  the  right 
hand,  the  dancer  should  jump  lightly  off 
the  ground,  landing  at  the  first  beat  of 
the  music  simultaneously  on  the  toes  of 
both  feet,  the  right  foot  being  in  front ; 
the  right  foot  is  now  raised  and  placed 
to  the  right  to  the  second  beat  of  the 
music,  and  is  followed  up  by  the  left 
to  the  third  beat,  and  so  on  to  seven 
beats  of  music,  the  last  movement  being 
that  of  the  left  foot.  If  dancing  in  the 
direction  of  the  left  hand,  the  left  foot 
should  be  brought  to  the  front  at  start- 
ing, and  the  seventh  beat  in  this  case 
would,  of  course,  be  with  the  right  foot. 
This  movement  is  completed  to  two  bars 
of  music.  At  this  stage  the  dancer  per- 
forms (in  the  case  of  a  reel)  one,  two. 
three,  backwards  and  forwards — referred 
to  generally  throughout  this  book  as 
two  short  threes;  in  the  case  of  a  jig. 
however,  the  "  rising-step  "  is  danced  by 
the  gentleman,  and  the  "  shuffle  "  by  the 
lady,  instead  of  the  two  short  threes ; 
either  of  these  movements  is  performed 
to  two  bars  of  music. 

The  charm  of  most  round  dances  de- 
pends largely  on  the  grace  with  which 
the  side-step  is  danced;  no  effort  should 
therefore  be  spared  to  acquire  this  ele- 
mentarv  dance  accurately  and  grace- 
fully. 

THE  two  short  threes  and  the  rising-step 
have  been  already  referred  to  and  must 
be  learned  from  some  one  who  knows 


The  step  used  throughout  the  dances, 
except  where  some  other  step  is  par- 
ticularly mentioned,  is  a  simple,  one, 
two.  three  movement.  Wherever  the 
terms  "  dance,"  "  turn,"  "  set,"  "  bal- 
ance," are  used  in  this  book,  it  is  al- 
ways to  be  understood  that  this  step 
is  used,  modified  to  the  particular  cir- 
cumstance. 


THE  various  forms  of  Irish  Dances  which 
exist  at  the  present  time  may  be  divided 
as  follows:  — 

I. 


Rinnci 

(STEP  DANCES). 

i.e.,  single  and  double  jig,  single  reel, 
hornpipe,  and  hop-time. 

II. 

llmnci    Aipice. 
(FIGUBE  OR  SET  DANCES). 

Such  as  St.  Patrick's  Day,  the  Black- 
bird, Rodney's  Glory,  the  Humours  of 
Bandon,  etc.  The  figure  dances  are 
mostly  for  tunes  which  are  "  irregular  " 
in  structure  that  is  which  do  not  consist 
of  two  parts  of  eight  bars  each.  They 
are  danced  usually  by  ona  person,  but 
sometimes,  and  in  some  districts,  by  two 
or  three  persons  together. 

III. 
Umnci   pijce. 

(ROUND  DANCES). 

Such  as  4,  6,  8,  12,  and  16  hand  reels 
and  jigs. 

IV. 

(OTHER  DANCES). 

Such  as  the  3  hand  reel  and  certain  4 
and  8  hand  reels  (generally  dances  which 
form  a  combination  of  I.  and  III  or 
II.  and  III). 

V. 

tlinnci  pvo,A  -j  tlinnci  m6fVA. 

(LONG  AND  COUNTRY  DANCES). 
Such  as  the  "  Kerry  Dance." 

The  only  dances  which  are  fully  de- 
scribed in  this  book  are  those  which 
come  under  the  headings  III.  and  V. 


Classifi- 
cation 
of

ROUND      DANCES. 

THE  most  perfect  of  the  Irish  round 
dances  are  divided  into  four  distinct 
parts,  viz. :  — 

Lead  Round 

Body 

Fir/ urea 

Finish 


Lead  I  The   lead  round    is  the    opening   of  the 

Round  i  dance  and  is  not  repeated  during  the 
I  performance  of  the  dance. 

Body  The  body  contains  a  certain  number  of 

sections,  and  is  danced  directly  after  the 
lead  round,  being  followed  by  a  figure, 
and  then  danced  through  again  before 
the  performance  of  another  figure;  it  is 
also  danced  between  the  last  figure  and 
the  finish. 

Figures  |  THE  figures  are  very  numerous,  and  there 
is  no  set  rule,  in  the  majority  of  cases, 
as  to  their  order  in  any  particular  dance, 
this  being  left  to  the  fancy  of  the  dan- 
cers, though  it  should  invariably  be 
settled  before  the  dance  begins.  The 
forms  of  the  figures  are  varied  and  re- 
quire the  participation  of  one.  two,  or 
four  couples. 


Fif/ures  requiring   the  participation  of 
one  couple, 

IN  dancing  a  4  hand  reel,  or  jig,  it  is 
usual  for  the  leading  couple  to  dance 
the  figure,  after  which  the  body  is 
danced,  and  then  the  other  couple  pro- 
ceed to  execute  the  same  figure. 

In  an  8  or  12  hand,  however,  when 
dancing  a  figure  of  this  sort  the  op- 
posite couples  execute  it.  one  immedi- 
ately after  the  other  without  interposing 
the  body  of  the  dance. 


In  dancing  a  16  hand  it  is  customary 
for  four  couples  to  execute  the  figure 
before  the  body  is  again  danced ;  firs 
the  leading  and  side  couples,  and  thei 
the  intermediate  couples. 


Figures  requiring  the  participation  of 
tico  couplet. 

IN  an  8  hand,  the  leading  and  opposite 
couples  execute  the  figure  first  and  are 
followed  by  side  couples  after  the  body 
has  been  again  danced. 

In  a  12  hand,  it  is  performed  by  the 
3  pairs  of  couples  in  succession,  the 
body  being  danced  before  each  perform- 
ance. 

In  a  16  hand,  leading  and  opposite 
couples  dance  the  figure,  and  are  im- 
mediately followed  by  side  couples;  the 
body  being  again  danced,  the  inter- 
mediate couples  proceed  to  execute  the 
figure  in  like  manner. 


Figures  requiring  the  participation  of 

four   couples. 

IN  an  8  hand  reel  or  jig  such  figures 
are  danced  only  once;  in  a  16  hand, 
they  are  danoed  by  the  leading  and  side 
couples  first,  and  after  body  has  been 
again  danced,  by  the  intermediate 
couples. 

THE  finish  which  concludes  the  dance,  is 
executed  by  all  couples  at  once  ;  it  should 
not  be  omitted,  as  is  too  often  the  case. 

SOME  of  the  dances  described  in  this 
book  do  not  conform  to  the  rules  given 
above,  that  is,  they  do  not  contain  the 
four  parts  mentioned;  their  description 
has,  however,  been  inserted  just  as  taken 
down.

GRACE    AND    STYLE. 

PARTICULAR  attention  should  be  paid  to 
performing  all  the  movements  grace- 
fully. The  carriage  of  the  body  should 
be  natural  and  easy.  Each  movement 
should  be  finished  by  all  dancers  ex- 
actly to  the  time  of  the  music,  and  care 
should  be  taken  to  maintain  throughout 
the  symmetry  of  the  figures  performed, 
by  each  dancer  coming  into  his  or  her 
proper  place,  and  at  the  proper  time. 
When  holding  your  partner's  hands, 
both  elbows  should  be  well  bent,  and 
the  hands  held  at  about  shoulder  level. 

TECHNICAL   TERMS. 

THE  term  "  Set "  refers  to  a  movement 
in  which  the  dancer,  without  materially 
changing  his  position,  dances  alternately 
to  left  and  right,  performing  whilst  do- 
ing so  the  simple  one,  two,  three,  step. 

THE  term  "  Balance,"  used  in  the  de- 
scription of  some  "  Country  dances,"  re- 
fers to  a  movement  similar  to  that  of 
"setting,"  only  that  the  dancer  here 
moves  independently,  instead  of  having 
both  hands  engaged  as  in  the  case  of 
"  setting." 

THE  term  "  Contrary  Couple,"  used  in 
connection  with  8,  12,  and  16  hand 
dances,  is  applied  to  either  one  of  the 
couples  dancing  together  whenever 
these  are  not  directly  opposite  to  one 
another ;  for  instance  (referring  to  the 
diagrams  on  pages  9  and  10),  in  section 
(a)  of  the  "  Body  "  of  any  particular 
dance  (see  Part  IV.)  the  "  contrary 
couples"  will  be  as  follow:  — 

8  hand— 1  &  3  and  2  &  4. 
12  hand—I  &  3.  2  &  6,  and  4  &  5. 
j      16  hand— 1  &  5,  3  &  8,  2  &  6,  and  4  &  7. 


This  means  that  the  leading  couple 
always  commences  dancing  the  "  Body  " 
with  the  couple  on  left,  and  the  other 
couples  arrange  themselves  accordingly. 
The  second  section  of  the  body  is  danoed 
by  leading  couple  with  the  couple  on 
right,  the  third  section  with  couple  on 
left,  and  so  on  alternately  through  the 
dance,  all  the  other  couples  taking  their 
cue  from  the  leading  couple. 


PRECEDENCE  OF  COUPLES  IN 
ROUND    AND   LONG    DANCES. 

THE  couples  are  usually  designated  in 
their  order  of  precedence  for  the  various 
dances  as  follows,  bearing  in  mind  that 
the  "  leading  couple "  is  always  that 
nearest  the  music. 

The  mark  O  designates  a  lady. 

,,          X  „         a  gentleman.

LONG  OR  COUNTRY  DANCES. 

IN  Long  or  Country  dances  the  "  Lead- 
ing couple  "  is  that  in  which  the  gentle- 
man's left  arm  is  out  from  the  line  of 
dancers,  as  shown  in  the  following  dia- 
gram:—

(LEAD    ROUND). 

THE  Lead  Round  is  performed  in  the 
following  manner.  The  first  two  bars 
of  the  music  are  allowed  to  pass, 
couples  then  lead  round  in  circle  to 
right  (gentleman  holding  lady's  left 
hand  in  his  right),  the  next  six  bars 
of  music  take  couples  to  their  respective 
places,  where  they  release  hands,  re- 
verse (gentleman  holding  lady's  right 
hand  in  his  left)  and  return  to  place 
in  opposite  direction  to  next  six  bars  of 
music;  partners  now  take  both  hands 
and  dance  one  full  turn  in  place  to  the 
last  two  bars,  each  coming  to  rest  in 
own  position. 

In  the  lead  round  an  equal  distance 
between  the  couples  should  be  main- 
tained, and  care  should  be  taken  that 
all  couples  start  and  finish  with  the 
music.

(BODY) 

THE  body  of  every  round  dance  is  di- 
vided into  a  number  of  sections,  each 
one  of  which  is  danced  to  a  specified 
number  of  bars  of  music.  The  first 
section  of  the  body  of  most  round  dances 
is  what  is  termed  Sides;  as,  however, 
the  performance  of  this  section  varies 
in  a  number  of  cases,  it  will  be  described 
with  the  particular  dance  in  which  it 
occurs. 

Certain  other  sections  of  the  body  be- 
ing performed  in  a  similar  manner  in 
many  dancas  a  description  of  these  will 
now  be  given,  so  that  when  dealing  with 
the  dances  themselves  it  will  be  only 
necessary  to  refer  to  the  words  of  com 
maud  given.  These  are  as  follow:  —

generally,  with  special  reference  to  the 
position  to  be  occupied  by  the  dancers 
and  the  movements  which  are  customary 
between  the  dancing  of  the  actual  steps. 

THE  jig  is  in  six-eight  time,  which  may 
be  in  structure  either  single  or  double, 
a  difference  which  is  explained  under 
the  heading  of  Danoe  Music.  Jigs  are 
divided  into  two  parts  of  eight  bars 
each.  For  purposes  of  dancing,  each 
part  is  played  twice  before  proceeding 
to  play  the  other  part — to  conform  with 
the  usual  mode  of  dancing  jigs.  The 
dancer  commences  with  the  right  foot, 
dances  his  steps  till  the  completion  of 
eight  bars,  when  he  doubles  the  step, 
that  is,  dances  it  over  again,  the  left  foot 
this  time  doing  exactly  what  the  right 
foot  did  during  the  first  eight  bars,  and 
vice  versa.  This  completes  a  double 
step,  after  which  the  dancers  give  hands 
across  and  dance  round  to  right  and 
back  again  to  left  during  the  next  six- 
teen bars,  when  the  steps  are  resumed, 
and  so  on.  The  jig  may  be  danced 
singly  or  by  one  or  more  couples ;  in 
the  former  case  the  dancer,  on  the  com- 
pletion of  each  double  set  of  steps, 
dances  round  in  a  circle  during  sixteen 
bars.  If  danced  with  a  partner  the 
couple  commence  by  taking  hands,  and 
advancing  during  four  bars,  retiring  in 
four  bars,  turn  partner  round  to  right 


Jig 


and  place  her  in  a  position  opposite  him 
where  she  will  dance  her  steps.  Be- 
tween each  set  of  double  steps  the  part- 
ners give  right  hands  across  in  centre, 
and  dance  round  to  right  [6  bars],  fall 
back  to  place  and  shuffle  [2  bars],  then 
left  hands  across,  dance  round  to  left, 
and  fall  back  to  place  as  before.  When 
two  couples  dance  the  jig,  all  four  cross 
hands  in  the  centre.  In  Irish  dances 
the  term  "  dancing  foot  "  is  applied  to 
the  foot  which  is  off  the  floor,  for  ex- 
ample, in  the  jig  steps  the  right  foot 
leads  off  with  the  "  rising  step;"  in  this 
case  the  right  foot  is  the  dancing  foot.  On 
doubling  the  jig,  however,  the  left  foot 
leads  off;  in  this  case  the  left  is  the 
dancing  foot. 


Reel  THE  reel  is  written  in  two-four  or  com- 

mon time  and  is  always  danced  singly 
that  is,  the  parts  are  never  doubled. 
Steps  are  danced  to  eight  bars,  then  the 
dancers  glide  round  in  a  circle  to  the 
next  8  bars,  when  they  resume  their 
steps,  performing  as  a  rule  the  reverse  of 
the  former  step.  In  some  places  the 
"  side-step  "  is  substituted  for  the  glide 
round ;  in  this  case  the  man  invariably 
dances  to  the  right  behind  his  partner 
and  back  to  place  in  front  of  her.  This 
form,  though  more  fatiguing,  is  some- 
what more  graceful  than  the  glide  round. 
It  is  the  custom  in  many  places  to  di- 
vide the  reel  into  two  portions,  the  first 
portion  consisting  of  simple,  graceful 
movements,  wholly  devoid  of  trebling, 
the  second  portion  consisting  almost 
solely  of  the  most  difficult  trebling  steps. 
The  division  between  the  two  parts  is 
usually  marked  by  the  partners  giving 
hands  across  and  dancing  round  as  in 
the  jig.  This  is  the  most  general  mode  of 
dancing  a  reel ;  in  Donegal,  however,  it  is 


77 


usual  for  one  or  two  men  to  place  their 
partners  on  the  right  hand  and  face 
the  player  in  a  line  across  the  floor. 
After  dancing  four  bars  in  this  position 
the  men  swing  their  partners  to  a  posi- 
tion facing  them,  and  the  remainder  of 
the  danoe  consists  of  dancing  a  step  to 
one  part  (eight  bars)  of  the  music  and 
turning  partners  and  marking  time  to 
the  other  part. 

THE  hornpipe,  like  the  reel,  is  written 
in  two-four,  or  common  time,  but  with 
a  difference  in  structure  which  is  ex- 
plained under  the  heading  of  Dance 
Music.  It  is  usually  danced  by  one 
man  alone,  or  by  two  men  who  stand 
opposite  each  other.  It  is  rarely  danced 
by  women.  Like  the  jig,  it  is  danced 
to  double  time,  sixteen  bars  being  de- 
voted to  steps  and  16  more  to  a  kind 
of  promenade  or  glide  round  in  a  circle 
keeping  time  to  the  music  by  the  simple 
one,  two,  three,  movement.  When 
danced  by  two  it  assumes  the  character 
of  a  friendly  contest,  each  man  dancing 
his  steps  in  turn,  one  resting  while  the 
other  is  dancing.  In  Donegal  the  horn- 
pipe is  usually  danced  with  twelve  steps, 
each  step  having  an  appropriate  "cover" 
or  finish  differing  from  the  steps. 

THE  hop-jig  is  in  the  unusual  nine-eight 
time  and  consists  of  two  parts  of 
eight  bars  each.  The  music  is  doubled 
as  in  the  jig,  that  is,  the  first  part  of 
eight  bars  is  played  twice,  then  the 
second  part  twice,  and  so  on ;  the  dance 
on  the  other  hand  is  performed  like  the 
reel,  namely,  eight  bars  of  stepping  fol- 
lowed by  eight  bars  of  promenade  round, 
then  eight  bars  of  stepping,  and  so  on 
to  the  end  of  the  dance.  It  is  usually 
danced  by  one  or  more  couples,  each 


Horn- 
pipe 


Hop-jig 


78 


couple  dancing  independently  of  the 
other  couples.  The  couples  stand  facing 
each  other  and  at  the  opening  of  the 
music  all  go  round  in  a  semi-circle  to 
the  right  [3  bars],  turn  to  the  right  [1 
bar],  dance  back  to  original  position 
[3  bars],  turn  in  position  to  left  [1  b'ar]. 
Steps  are  then  danced  during  the  next 
8  bars,  when  the  glide  round  in  a  semi- 
circle is  resumed,  and  so  on.  This  glide 
round  between  the  steps  is  simple  though 
peculiar  and  when  well  danced  looks 
very  graceful.  With  the  first  beat  of 
the  music  the  toe  of  the  right  foot  is 
advanced  some  distance,  at  the  next  ac- 
cent of  the  music  the  toe  of  the  left 
foot  is  placed  behind  the  right  heel,  to 
the  next  two  accents  of  the  music  the  same 
movement  is  repeated,  except  that  while 
in  the  first  movement  the  dancer  ad- 
vances from  twenty  to  twenty  four  in- 
ches, in  the  second  movement  he  ad- 
i  vances  not  more  than  three  or  four 
I  inches.  This  occupies  one  bar  of  music, 
the  next  two  bars  are  danced  in  a  pre- 
cisely similar  manner,  the  fourth  bar 
is  devoted  to  the  turn  which  is  done  by 
beating  time,  in  one  long  and  four 
short  steps  (right,  left,  right,  left,  right), 
•to  the  music.  The  fifth  step  should 
bring  the  dancers  into  a  position 
to  dance  back  in  the  same  semi- 
circle to  their  original  positions.  The 
return  is  similarly  danced,  the  left 
foot  being  in  front  this  time.  At  the 
end  of  the  fourth  bar  the  man  should 
be  in  the  position  originally  occupied  by 
his  partner,  she  having  reached  the  posi- 
tion originally  occupied  by  him.  At 
the  end  of  the  eighth  bar  both  should 
be  again  at  their  own  positions.  It  is 
best  to  practice  this  dance  to  a  tune 
like  the  "  Rocky  Road  to  Dublin,"  in 
which  the  accents  are  clearly  marked.

FIGURE    DANCES. 

THE  Figure,  or,  as  they  are  sometimes 
called,  "  Set "  dances  are  very  numerous 
and  are  usually  associated  with  tunes 
which  are  "  irregular  "  in  structure,  that 
is,  which  do  not  consist  of  the  usual  two 
parts  of  eight  bars  each.  The  dances 
consist  mostly  of  a  certain  number  of 
steps  joined  together  by  a  "Figure"  or 
"  Set."  As  a  general  rule  they  were 
only  taught  to  the  most  expert  dancers, 
the  steps  being  usually  very  intricate. 
The  list  of  these  dances  appended  makes 
no  claim  to  be  a  complete  one,  but  it 
contains  the  best  known  danoes  of  this 
class.

THIS  is  a  favourite  Munster  Figure 
Dance.  It  is  in  six-eight  or  jig-time, 
and  is  composed  of  two  parts,  with  eight 
bars  in  the  first  part  and  fourteen  in 
the  second.  The  tune  is  given  by  Dr. 
Joyce  in  his  Ancient  Irish  Music,  and 
a  somewhat  different  setting  of  it  will 
be  found  under  the  title  of  Ree  Raw 
(Uij  AH  t'A^A)  i°  Dr.  Petrie's  Ancient 
Music  of  Ireland. 

THIS  is  the  name  by  which  a  Donegal 
five-hand  reel  is  usually  known.  It  is 
so  called  from  the  fcucAijie  (interloper, 
eavesdropper),  the  name  applied  to  the 
odd  lady  or  gentleman.  It  consists  of 
alternate  swinging  and  stepping ;  var- 
iety is  lent  by  the  fcucAijie  coming  into 
the  dance  at  each  turn,  a  fresh  person 
being  left  out,  and  so  on. 
THIS  is  another  Figure  dance  of  an 
"  irregular "  time.  It  is  written  in 
four  phrases,  the  first  of  five  bars,  the 
second  of  five  bars,  which  are  repeated 
to  form  the  third  phrase,  and  the  fourth 
is  a  repetition  of  the  first  phrase. 
ANOTHER  Figure  dance.  The  tune,  which 
is  in  hornpipe  time,  is  given  in  Dr.  Joyce's 
Ancient  Irish  Music,  and  consists  of  two 
parts,  with  the  unusual  number  of  twelve 
bars  in  each  part.  The  name  implies 
the  highest  degree  of  excellence  in  pipe 
playing. 

THIS  is  also  an  "  irregular  "  Irish  dance 
tune  which  will  be  found  in  several  col- 
lections of  Irish  dance  music.  It  con- 
sists of  eight  bars  in  the  first  part  and 
fourteen  in  the  second.  It  is  a  fav- 
ourite Munster  Figure  dance,  and  is 
danced  by  one  or  two  people. 


81 


IN  Donegal  this  is  danced  as  a  "sling" 
(i.e.,  slip)  jig,  with  a  fixed  set  of  steps. 
In  Munster  the  tune  of  this  name  is  a 
favourite  hop-jig  tune. 

THERE  is  a  dance,  bearing  this  title, 
known  in  East  Cork.  It  is  generally  per- 
formed to  the  air  of  the  "  Western 
Dane"  (PDame)  which  is  in  jig-time. 
It  is  usually  danced  by  two  persons. 
The  dance  is  known  in  Tipperary  also. 

THIS  is  the  title  of  another  Figure  dance, 
which  appears  to  be  peculiar  to  Bast 
Cork.  It  is  usually  danced  by  two  or 
four  people. 

THIS  dance,  in  jig  time,  is  also  peculiar 
to  East  Cork.  It  is  usually  danced  by 
twelve  people. 

THIS  is  danced  to  the  tune  of  the  same 
name.  It  somewhat  resembles  the 
"  Single,"  and  requires  three  people  to 
dance  it.  It  has  a  chain  figure. 

THIS  is  one  of  the  best  known  Donegal 
"  set "  dances.  It  is  danced  to  an  air 
of  that  name,  which  is  the  same  as  the 
air  of  the  Scottish  song  "  Whistle  o'er 
the  lave  o't."  In  Donegal  there  are 
several  Figure  or  "  Set "  dances  in  which 
twelve  steps,  or  a  less  number,  are 
danced  to  a  particular  tune.  The  steps 
are  always  the  same  in  any  particular 
dance. 

THIS  is  another  Donegal  Figure  dance, 
which  is  danced  to  a  tune  of  that  name.

PANTOMIMIC   DANCES. 

TUNES  of  occupation,  such  as  the  Car- 
penters' March,  spinning  songs,  cradle 
songs,  ploughmen's  whistles,  milking 
songs,  are  of  frequent  occurrence  in  our 
collections  of  traditional  music.  Some- 
thing of  the  same  kind  appears  to  have 
existed  in  our  dances,  though  in  a  lesser 
degree.  Among  these  peculiar  dances 
which,  for  want  of  a  better  name,  we 
term  pantomimic  dances,  the  followinf 
were  the  most  common  :  —

Ttinnce  An  cipin. 

ACCORDING  to  Sir  William  Wilde,  this 
term  was  applied  in  Connaught  to  a 
long  pointed  stick  used  in  setting  po- 
tatoes; and  there  was  a  tune  of  this 
name  known  in  parts  of  the  West,  which 
was  accompanied  by  an  odd  sort  of 
dance,  a  kind  of  pantomimic  representa- 
tion of  the  whole  process  of  potato  plant- 
ing. In  Munster  the  term  is  understood 
to  mean  a  stick  for  planting  cabbages. 
The  tune  is  an  ordinary  double  jig  in 
two  parts  with  eight  bars  in  each. 

THIS  was  also  danced  to  a  tune  of  that 
name.  It  is  known  throughout  Munster. 
but  appears  to  have  been  at  one  time 
performed  as  a  sort  of  festal  or  panto- 
mimic dance  by  the  butchers  of  Limerick 
city.  Like  our  other  pantomimic  dances 
it  is  reputed  to  be  very  old. 

DANCED  by  two  people  to  reel  time.  At 
one  part  of  the  dance  the  dancers  close 
fists  and  make  a  sort  of  attack  and  de- 
fence to  the  time  of  the  music.  Coola- 
gurra  is  the  old  Irish  name  of  a  village 
now  called  Mount  Uniacke  in  the  parish 


83 


of  Killeagh,  Co.  Cork,  where  it  has  been 
a  favourite  dance.  As  the  alteration 
in  the  name  of  the  place  from  Coola- 
gurra  to  Mount  Uniacke  took  effect  as 
far  back  as  1703,  some  idea  will  be 
formed  of  the  antiquity  of  the  dance. 


THIS,  the  most  remarkable  of  our  panto- 
mimic dances,  appears  to  have  been  con- 
fined to  the  Co.  Wexford,  where  it  was 
danced  until  quite  recently.  The  name 
has  so  far  puzzled  antiquarians.  Patrick 
Kennedy  in  his  "  Banks  of  the  Boro',  " 
gives  the  following  description  of  it  as 
he  saw  it  danced  in  the  year  1812: — 

"  Six  men  or  boys  stood  in  line  at 
reasonable  distances  apart,  all  armed  with 
short  cudgels.  When  the  music  began, 
feet,  arm?,  and  cudgels  commenced  to 
keep  time,  each  dancer  swaying  his  body 
to  the  right  and  left,  described  an 
upright  figure  of  eight  with  the  cudgels. 
In  these  movements  no  noise  was  made, 
but  at  certain  periods  the  arms  moved 
rapidly  up  and  down,  the  upper  and 
lower  halves  of  the  right-hand  sticks 
striking  at  the  lower  half  of  the  left- 
hand  stick  in  the  descent  of  the  right 
arm,  the  upper  half  in  the  ascent,  and 
vice  versa.  At  the  proper  point  of  the 
march  each  man  commenced  a  kind  of 
fencing  with  the  man  opposite  him,  and 
the  clanks  of  the  cudgels  coincided  with 
the  beats  of  the  music  and  the  move- 
ments of  the  feet.  Then  commenced 
the  involutions,  evolutions,  interlacings. 
and  windings,  every  one  striking  at  the 
person  with  whom  the  movement  brought 
him  face  to  face.  The  sounds  of  the 
sticks  supplied  the  bookings  in  the  reels. 
The  steps  danced  were  not  difficult. 
The  war  dance  was  performed  to  martial 
tunes  resembling  Brian  Boru's  March."

(Stick 
Dance) 


THIS  is  our  present  form  of  the  sword 
dance  (sticks  being  substituted  for 
swords)  of  the  existence  of  which  in 
Ireland  there  is  some  evidence.  In 
the  Rev.  P.  S.  Dineen's  edition  of  the 
poems  of  O'Rahilly  there  is  a  stanza 
from  an  old  e!egy  quoted  in  which  some 
of  the  pastimes  indulged  in  of  old  in 
great  Irish  houses  are  mentioned.

It  may  be  reasonably  inferred  that  the 
modern  Uinnce  AH  ctpin  is  the  lineal, 
though  somewhat  degenerate  descend- 
ant of  the  sword  dance ;  and  if  we  are 
to  seek  its  original  form  we  must  look 
to  the  Scottish  Highlands  for  it. 

ANOTHER  dance  of  the  existence  of  which, 
as  early  as  1680,  we  have  evidence,  is 
what  is  generally  known  by  the  name 
of  the  Cake-Dance,  no  doubt  a  mere  de- 
scriptive name  given  to  it  by  writers 
who  were  unable  to  comprehend  the 
real  name.  So  far  as  can  be  ascer- 
tained it  was  peculiar  to  the  West  of 
Ireland.  A  cake,  one  account  goes,  was 
set  upon  a  distaff,  and  this  was  the 
signal  of  pleasure  and  became  the  re- 
ward of  talent;  it  is  sometimes  carried 
off  by  the  best  dancer,  and  sometimes  by 
the  archest  wag  of  the  country.  At  a 
little  distance  from  this  standard  of 
revelry  is  placed  its  chief  agent,  the 
piper,  who  is  always  seated  on  the 
ground  with  a  hole  dug  near  him  into 
which  the  contributions  of  the  company 
are  dropped ;  at  the  end  of  every  jig 


the  piper  is  paid  by  the  young  man 
who  dances  it,  and  who  endeavours  to 
enhance  the  value  of  the  gift  by  first 
bestowing  it  on  his  fair  partner — a  prac- 
tice which  was  in  vogue  until  very  re- 
cently. Though  a  penny  a  jig  is 
esteemed  very  good  pay,  yet  the  gal- 
lantry and  ostentation  of  the  contributor, 
anxious  at  once  to  appear  generous  in  the 
eyes  of  his  mistress,  and  to  out-strip  the 
liberality  of  his  rivals,  sometimes  trebles 
the  sum  which  the  piper  usually  receives. 
Miss  Owenson,  the  Lady  Morgan  of  later 
days,  writing  in  the  beginning  of  the 
19th  century,  states  that  she  was  often 
at  these  cake  dances  and  observed  the 
inordinate  passion  for  dancing,  so  pre 
valent  among  the  peasants.  It  was 
very  rare  in  fact  to  find  an  individual 
who  had  not  been  for  some  time  under 
the  tuition  of  a  dancing  master. 

That  the  Cake-dance  was  of  some  an- 
tiquity, is  shown  by  a  reference  to  it 
by  Vallancey  in  his  Collectanea  de  Rebus 
Hibernicis.  There  he  tells  us  how 
on  the  patron  day  in  most  parishes, 
as  also  the  feasts  of  Easter  and  Whit- 
suntide, the  more  ordinary  sort  of  people- 
met  near  the  ale  house  in  the  after 
noon  and  danced  for  the  cake;  the 
piper  was  there  of  course,  and  the  cake 
was  provided  at  the  charge  of  the  ale- 
wife.  It  was  advanced  on  a  board 
on  top  of  a  pike  about  10  feet  high ; 
the  board  was  round  and  from  it  rose  a 
garland  beset  and  tied  round  with 
meadow  flowers  if  it  be  in  the  early 
summer,  if  later,  the  garland  was  set 
out  with  apples  set  round  on  pegs ;  then 
the  whole  of  the  dancers  began  at  once 
in  a  large  ring,  a  man  and  a  woman 
danced  round  about  the  bush ;  the  dan 
oers  who  hold  out  the  longest  win  the 
oake  and  apples.

OTHER  ROUND  AND  LONG 
DANCES. 

IN  addition  to  the  Round  and  Long 
dances  described  in  Part  IV.,  there  are 
some  others,  of  which  the  following  ap- 
pear to  be  the  most  important. 

THIS  reel,  which  is  sometimes  called  the 
Scottish  reel,  is  danced  by  two  men 
and  their  partners.  The  arrangement 
is  somewhat  peculiar.  The  men  stand 
back  to  back,  and  the  women  face  their 
partners.  During  the  first  half  of  the 
tune,  the  dancers  perform  a  figure  re- 
sembling the  figure  of  8,  the  men  falling 
in  with  opposite  partners  alternately,  and 
the  women  always  returning  to  their 
own  place.  They  dance  a  step  to 
the  second  half  of  the  tune  and  start 
off  again  at  the  turn  of  the  music.  This 
is  a  graceful  and  lively  reel.  In  Done- 
gal, as  elsewhere,  all  reels  of  this  class 
are  played  in  double  time. 

THIS    is   danced  by   one    man   and   two 

women,    and   it  is  usual    to   dance   two 

reels  together.  It  has  a  number  of 
figures. 

DANCED  by  competitors  from  Gorey  at  the 
Wexford  Feis  held  at  Enniscorthy  in 
Oct.,  1902.  The  dance  contained  a  cer- 
tain number  of  "  steps  "  and  appeared 
to  have  the  full  complement  of  parts. 
It  was  taught  the  competitors  by  the 
father  of  one  of  them  and  had.  to  his 
knowledge,  been  danced  for  at  least  a 
couple  of  generations  in  that  district. 

DANCED  by  competitors  from  toe  neAriiAijt, 
Cavan,  branch  of  the  Gaelic  League  at 
the  Leinster  Feis.  1902.  It  has  the  full 
complement  of  parts,  viz.,  opening, 
body,  figures,  and  finish. 


THIS  is  danced  to  a  tune  of  the  same 
name  in  jig  time.  It  may  be  danced 
by  any  number  of  persons.  The  couples 
stand  facing  each  other  as  in  the  Long 
dances. 

ANOTHER  Long  dance,  to  a  tune  of  the 
same  name  in  jig  time. 


IRISH  DANCE   MUSIC. 

FOR  a  number  of  reasons  it  has  been 
found  necessary  to  restrict,  at  least  for 
the  present,  this  section  of  the  book 
merely  to  the  consideration  of  Irish 
dance  music  in  so  far  as  it  bears  on 
Irish  dances. 

THE  jig  is  the  most  characteristic  musi- 
cal measure  among  Irish  dance  tunes.  It 
is  in  six-eight  time,  ia  divided,  if  "  regu- 
lar ",  into  two  equal  parts  of  eight  bars 
each,  and  may  be  in  structure  either 
double  or  single.  In  a  double  jig  the 
bar  usually  consists  of  6  quavers  in  two 
triplets;  in  a  single  jig,  however,  a  crot- 
chet followed  by  a  quaver  takes  the 
place  of  the  triplet  in  the  double  jig. 
For  dancing  purposes  all  regularly  con- 
structed jigs  are  played  in  double  time, 
that  is,  the  first  part  of  eight  bars  is 
played  twice,  the  second  eight  bars  is 
then  played  twice,  and  so  on.  There 
are  a  number  of  Irish  tunes,  which 
though  in  jig  time  are  "  irregular,"  in 
the  sense  that  they  do  not  consist  of 
two  equal  parts  of  8  bars  each.  The 
tune  Patrick's  Day  is  an  example  of 
this  class  of  jig;  it  has  eight  bars  in 
the  first  part  and  6  in  the  second.  The 
ordinary  jig  cannot,  obviously,  be  danced 
to  tunes  of  this  class.

The  following  are  good  jig  tunes  for 
dancing  purposes : —

Man's  Rambles,  Tatter  Jack  Walsh,  The

Reel  and  BOTH  reel  and  hornpipe  are  written  in 
Hornpipe!  two-four,  or  common  time,  but  there  is 
this  difference  between  them,  that  in  the 
hornpipe  there  are  usually  two  accents 
where  there  is  only  one  in  the  reel. 
In  other  words  the  former  is  a  much 
more  jerky  measure  than  the  latter ;  the 
reel,  indeed,  is  the  smoothest  of  Irish 
dance  measures.  For  step  dancing  the 
reel  is  played  in  single  time;  the  horn- 
pipe, like  the  jig,  being  played  in  double 
rime.  For  round  dances,  however,  the 
reel  is  played  in  double  time. 

The  following  are  among  the  best,  as 
they  are  the  best  known,  Irish  reels  :  — 

Flower  of  Donnybrook,  Miss  M'Cloud, 
The  wind  that  shakes  the  barley,  Bonny 
Kate,  Limerick  Lasses,  The  Boyne 
Water,  Farewell  to  Whiskey,  The  Green 
Fields  of  Erin,  The  Pure  Drop,  All  the 
Ways  to  Galway,  Sc^icin  eofttiA. 


Kop-Jig 


THIS  is  written  in  nine-eight  time,  with 
nine  quavers,  in  three  triplets,  (or  the 
equivalent  thereof)  in  a  bar.  In  the 
opinion  of  Dr.  Petrie  the  measure  is 
almost  peculiar  to  Irish  music.  It  is 
played  double  both  for  step  dances  and 
country  dances. 

Hop-jig  tunes:— Rocky  Road  to  Dub- 
lin, Drops  of  Brandy,  Dublin  Streets, 
The  Munster  Gimlet,  Ride  a  Mile,  Cork 
City,  Lasses  of  Sligo.
